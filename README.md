##### Dear Scrutinizers, 

The master branch is as far as I got in two hours.
I realize that none of my inputs are sanitized :[
My next steps would have been:
    Alternate moves between player and AI
    Check for winning combinations
    Put things into classes as appropriate 
    Get game loops looping proper (option to play again, too)
    Sanitize inputs and other error handling


I am going to continue development on the cheeky branch, because I am having
fun. 
    
Thank you for you time and have a marvelous day.
